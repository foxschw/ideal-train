## For EACH of the items listed in specifications, provide a sentence or so describing how you accomplished the requirements. 
## Make sure you mention what files your grader should examine, and even better, what line(s) of code you modified.

Build the level. Create a UI text game object. Create a script called FPS Collided that gets attached to the PortalGunFPSController parent game object. In the script, set the alpha of the text object to zero and make an OnTriggerEnter function that checks if the FPS has collided with the game object at the end that should trigger the text. If it does, set the alpha to 1. If the user presses Enter, the game will reset.
I've  also made a moving ball obstacle in which uses ping pong function to move the ball along the Z axis. This script called Moving Ball gets attached to the ball itself.

## How would you rate your own design? Place an X in one of the set of brackets below. (Your answer will not have an impact on how the staff scores your design)

[ ] 1 - Poor. Work demonstrates poor understanding of week's concepts and problem set. Substantial improvements needed.

[ ] 2 - Fair. Work demonstrates fair understanding of week's concepts and problem set. Significant improvements needed.

[ ] 3 - Good. Work demonstrates good understanding of week's concepts and problem set. Some improvements needed, but at the benchmark of success for this point in the course.

[X] 4 - Better. Work demonstrates better than "good" understanding of week's concepts and problem set. Few improvements needed. Beyond the benchmark of success for this point in the course.

[ ] 5 - Best. Exceptional. No room for improvement. No modifications could improve efficiency.
